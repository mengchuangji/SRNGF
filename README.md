# 2023 TGRS Attenuation of Seismic Random Noise With Unknown Distribution: A Gaussianization Framework

This repo contains the official implementation for the paper [Attenuation of Seismic Random Noise With Unknown Distribution:A Gaussianization Framework](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10193802)
by Chuangji Meng, Jinghuai Gaoâˆ—, Yajun Tian, Liang Zhao, Haoqi Zhao, Zhiqiang Wang.

SRNGF couples the Gaussianization subproblem and Gaussian denoising subproblem based on the plug-and
play (PaP) framework. The Gaussianization submodule with learnable parameters maps seismic data with the noise of
unknown distribution to the one corrupted by Gaussian noise. The learnable parameters can be updated through unsupervised
online training according to the noise of the unknown distribution on a single field data. The Gaussian denoising submodule, which
can be replaced by seismic denoiser, aims only for Gaussian noise removal, making SRNGF incorporate the denoiser prior
to seismic data. SRNGF can improve the ability of non-DL/DL denoiser to suppress field noise by mapping unknown field noise
to the Gaussian noise. 

This is an example of using SRNGF($\widetilde{\mathbb{F}} , \widetilde{\mathbb{G}}$) to transform non-Gaussian/field noise into Gaussian noise in latent space.

### Running 
SRNGF($\widetilde{\mathbb{F}} , \widetilde{\mathbb{G}}$), when the Gaussian denoising operator $\widetilde{\mathbb{G}}$ is a (trained) deep learning model. 
In the .\model_zoo folder, we have provided some pretrained Checkpoints of deep models for implementing $\widetilde{\mathbb{G}}$  

```bash
python GVAE-deep*.py 
```
SRNGF($\widetilde{\mathbb{F}} , \widetilde{\mathbb{G}}$), when the Gaussian denoising operator $\widetilde{\mathbb{G}}$ is a non deep learning method.
In the .\seispro folder, we have provided some reproducible non-deep methods for implementing $\widetilde{\mathbb{G}}$  


**Note**:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***You can easily integrate your own (non-deep learning/deep learning) algorithms into SRNGF to further improve the ability to suppress unknown distribution noise.***

This is an example of incorporating a deep model ([VI-non-IID](https://github.com/mengchuangji/VI-Non-IID)) into SRNGF. The first to third rows are the denoising results, the removed noise, and the local similarity map, respectively. The second column is the result of VI-non-IID, and the third to seventh columns are the corresponding SRNGF results.
